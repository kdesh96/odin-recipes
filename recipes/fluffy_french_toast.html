    <h1>Fluffy French Toast</h1>

    <img src="../images/fluffy-french-toast.jpg" alt="fluffy french toast">

    <p class="describe-dish">This fluffy French toast recipe is crisp on the outside, but perfectly soft and tender on the inside. 
        So, what makes french toast fluffy?
        The secret ingredient in this fluffy French toast recipe: all-purpose flour! 
        Flour binds the liquids together, which creates a more traditional “batter” and helps prevent soggy results. 
        This extra ingredient ensures the French toast is crispy on the outside, but soft and fluffy on the inside.
