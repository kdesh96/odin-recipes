    <p>This fluffy French toast recipe is crisp on the outside, but perfectly soft and tender on the inside.  </p>
    <h2> What Makes French Toast Fluffy?  </h2>
    <p>
        The secret ingredient in this fluffy French toast recipe: all-purpose flour! 
        Flour binds the liquids together, which creates a more traditional “batter” and helps prevent soggy results. 
        This extra ingredient ensures the French toast is crispy on the outside, but soft and fluffy on the inside.
