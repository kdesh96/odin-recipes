    <p>
        Bruschetta (pronounced brew-SKET-tah) is an Italian appetizer or antipasti that starts with a base of toasted or grilled bread. 
        The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can build their own bruschetta. 
        Bruschetta is meant to be served as a hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites.
